## Additional Data for `NetOrigin` R package 

The `NetOrigin` R package  performs network-based source estimation. Different approaches are available: effective distance median, recursive backtracking, and centrality-based source estimation. Additionally, we provide public transportation network data as well as methods for data preparation, source estimation performance analysis and visualization.

The repository contains additional data exemplifying the Gaussian origin dectection algorithm. 

## Data Description

### Environment parameters List for KwaZulu-Natal

* `beta_max` maximum contact rate (day^-1)
